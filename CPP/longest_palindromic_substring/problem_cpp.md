# Longest Palindromic Substring

<p>
<em>This problem was recently asked by Twitter!</em>

A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards. Given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

**Example:**<br />
**Input:** "banana"<br />
**Output:** "anana"<br />

**Input:** "million"<br />
**Output:** "illi"<br />
</p>

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    std::string longestPalindrome(self, s)
    {
      // Fill this in.
    }
};
        
// Test program
std::string s = "tracecars";
std::cout << solution.longestPalindrome(s);
// racecar
```
